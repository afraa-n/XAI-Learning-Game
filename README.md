# XAI Learning Game

An innovative interactive game designed to teach the principles of Explainable AI (XAI) through engaging scenarios and intuitive visualizations. This project uses SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to help players interpret model predictions and understand feature importance.

## Motivation

The game bridges the gap between XAI concepts and practical understanding. By turning complex ideas into an engaging learning experience, it empowers players to make informed decisions about AI-driven insights.

## Artifact Overview

This project reflects the core principles of Responsible AI and Explainable AI by:
- Providing an intuitive, hands-on learning experience.
- Applying SHAP visualizations to new and interactive educational scenarios.
- Promoting the use of XAI for education and outreach.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players navigate multiple levels, analyze model predictions, and make decisions based on feature explanations.
- **XAI Integration:** Visualizations of SHAP values to interpret model outputs.
- **Engaging Feedback System:** Scores and progress tracking for players.
- **Customization Options:** Choose characters and personalize gameplay.
